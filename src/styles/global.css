* The main CSS variables and utility classes have been moved to src/index.css
* to create a single source of truth for styling across the application.
* 
* This approach prevents conflicts and ensures consistent gradients and colors
* throughout the application.
* 
* Please refer to src/index.css for the following:
* - CSS variables (colors, radii, etc.)
* - Gradient utility classes
* - Animation classes
* - Component styles
